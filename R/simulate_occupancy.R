#' Simulator for projecting bed occupancy
#'
#' This function predits bed occupancy from admission data (dates, and numbers
#' of admissions on these days). Duration of hospitalisation is provided by a
#' function returning `integer` values for the number of days in hospital.
#'
#' @param dates A vector of dates, ideally as `Date` but `integer` should work too.
#'
#' @param n_admissions An `integer` vector giving the number of admissions
#'   predicted for each date in `dates`.
#'
#' @param r_los A `function` with a single parameter `n` returning `n` `integer`
#'   values of lenth of hospital stay (LoS) in days. Ideally, this should come
#'   from a discrete random distribution, such as `rexp` or any `distcrete`
#'   object.
#'
#' @param n_sim The number of times duration of hospitalisation is simulated for
#'   each admission. Defaults to 10. Only relevant for low (<30) numbers of
#'   initial admissions, in which case it helps accounting for the uncertainty
#'   in LoS.

    ## Outline:

    ## We take a vector of dates and incidence of admissions, and turn this into a
    ## vector of admission dates, whose length is sum(n_admissions). We will
    ## simulate for each date of admission a duration of stay, and a corresponding
    ## vector of dates at which this case occupies a bed. Used beds are then
    ## counted (summing up all cases) for each day. To account for stochasticity
    ## in duration of stay, this process can be replicated `n_sim` times,
    ## resulting in `n_sim` predictions of bed needs over time.

                                                  by = 1L))
